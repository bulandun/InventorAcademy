    {
      question: "What's included in the program fee?",
      answer: "The program fee covers accommodation in Oxford, meals, expert-led workshops and seminars, all materials and equipment needed for projects, supervised excursions and cultural activities, supervision and support, and a graduation certificate. The only additional costs are personal expenses, travel to/from Oxford, and any optional extended excursions."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of accommodation can students expect?",
      answer: "Students stay in authentic Oxford college rooms, typically single study bedrooms with shared bathroom facilities. Rooms are furnished with a bed, desk, wardrobe, and basic amenities. Common areas include historic dining halls, libraries, and courtyards. All accommodation is within secure college grounds with 24/7 supervision. Bedding and towels are provided."
    },
    {
      question: "How are students supervised and what safety measures are in place?",
      answer: "We maintain a low staff-to-student ratio with qualified supervisors available. All staff undergo background checks and safeguarding training."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I need to cancel my booking?",
      answer: "We understand that circumstances can change. Cancellations more than 60 days before the program start receive a full refund minus a Â£200 administration fee. Cancellations 30-60 days before receive a 50% refund. Cancellations within 30 days are non-refundable unless due to medical reasons with documentation. We strongly recommend travel insurance to protect your investment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I receive a certificate upon completion?",
      answer: "Yes, all participants who successfully complete the program receive a Certificate of Achievement from The Inventors Academy. This certificate details the subjects studied, projects completed, and skills developed. While not a university qualification, it demonstrates participation in an intensive innovation program and can be valuable for university applications and CV building."
